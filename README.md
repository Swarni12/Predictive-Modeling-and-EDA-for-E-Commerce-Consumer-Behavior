# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering with Python

This project demonstrates the full pipeline of data analysis using Python — starting from data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying feature engineering techniques to prepare the dataset for modeling.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 🔧 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized column names and formats

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of important features
- Distribution plots, boxplots, and histograms
- Correlation heatmaps and visual insights

### 🛠️ 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new features from existing columns
- Categorical encoding, scaling, and transformation

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `eda_notebook.ipynb` – Complete notebook with data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering
- `README.md` – Project description
- `data` – Dataset used for analysis
